# Ergogen    [![Badge License]][License]

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.

The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.
