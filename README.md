# Ergogen    [![Badge License]][License]

Ergogen is a keyboard generator that aims to provide a common configuration format to describe **ergonomic** 2D layouts, and generate automatic plates, cases, and (un-routed) PCBs for them.

The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [Absolem keyboard](https://zealot.hu/absolem), and shares its [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nbKcAZB) as well.

<br>

## Getting Started

Until a proper 'Getting started' guide has been written, <br>
try getting familiar with **Ergogen** doing the following:

<br>

1. Read the **[Documentation]**.

    *It isn't complete by any measure, but should give* <br>
    *you a fairly good idea what you are dealing with.*
    
    <br>

2. Try one of the web-based deployments.

   [![Badge Official]][Deployment Official]   
   [![Badge Unofficial]][Deployment Unofficial]
   
   <br>
   
   *The unofficial deployment is probably* <br>
   *better and will soon be official as well.*
   
   #### CLI
   
   There is no need for you to download the **CLI** <br>
   unless you want to do one of the following:
   
   - Preview in-development features
   - Use custom modifications
   - Contribute code
   
   <br>
   
   *Click things, look at outputs and* <br>
   *see if things start to make sense.*
   
   <br>

3. Search the [`ergogen`][Topic] topic on GitHub <br>
   to look at / reverse engineer a variety <br>
   of real life configs using **Ergogen**.

   Pop them into the web UI to see what <br>
   they do, tinker with them and things <br>
   should start to make more sense.

   <br>

4. If a question persists after all of the above, <br>
   feel free to ask it over on **[Discord]** and we'll <br>
   do our best to help you out.
